# OOP-Portfolio
Showcase of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Course Material 
Programmed Using BlueJ 

Chapters/Topics Covered: 
- Objects & Classes
- Understanding Class Definitions
- Object Interaction
- Designing Classes
- Fixed-Size Collections (Arrays)
- Grouping Objects
- More-Sophisticated Object Behavior
- Well-Behaved Objects

The course emphasis is on the creation and use of "objects" as the basic tool for developing various program algorithms (such as finding the lowest common divisor, sorting an array, finding prime numbers, etc.), data structures (such as arrays, structures, strings, maps), programming processes (such as manipulating data files, passing parameters by value and by reference) and Graphical User Interface (GUI). Throughout the course there is an emphasis on the use of existing "classes" and the development of new, project-related classes.
